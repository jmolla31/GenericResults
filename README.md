# GenericResults
We all like to avoid writing boilerplate code right? | https://www.nuget.org/packages/GenericResults/

Generic result classes, useful as return types of methods. 

The main concept is that a result class encapsulates a possible result of type T, and a set of errors if something fails.

Before you ask, yeah, all classes are very similar to one another, this is done on purpose so each result clearly represents what type of action the method that returns the result is performing.
